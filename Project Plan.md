# Project Plan
## DELETE THIS WHEN COMPLETE WITH PROJECT!
Plan → Build → Deploy → Polish → Show your work

### Setup
1. Clone repository and open up workspace
2. Start virtual environment
3. Make sure the libraries are installed on the venv
4. Read in the kaggle dataset

### Create a pipeline that:
1. Cleans the data (removes all na values or imputes them with something)
2. Does some feature engineering (if we need)
3. Does data engineering (specifically grouping and doing what we need to)
4. Data analysis (display a graph or chart with user info vs calculated emmissions with MatPlotLib)

### Create a function gives us the carbon footprint
1. It should take in the dataset 
2. The function should query each entry in the API and capture the carbon footprint
3. It should add the carbon footprint as a column in the same row as the entry it jus queried
4. This function should return the original dataframe with carbon footprint attached to it

### Put it on Streamlit

### Put it on Hugging face (optional if we have time - lol)

## Requirements met:
✅ The python project MUST have a data analysis element

❌ One Python script for API use that is built into a function, and imported in a different script

❌ The API script should be able to be used stand alone in the CLI, if desired

✅ The Python project MUST use an API

✅ The Python project MUST be hosted on the web using Streamlit

❌ At least on text/image/video/selector input

❌ An output that changes based on the input

❌ At least one visual element (chart, image, or formatted table)

✅ The Python project MUST be hosted on Github

❌ Members of the team MUST be members of the Github repository (working on it)

❌ Instructors MUST be invited to the repository (We need to know his username to add him)

❌ Hugging Face Spaces repo must match GitHub (same files, README, and app behavior).

❌ Readme.md must have

❌ How to run locally

❌ How to run cli_demo.py

❌ Python version

❌ Link to the Hugging Faces Space

❌ Hugging Face Spaces repo mirrors GitHub (same README and files).

❌ No hard-coded API secrets in the repo (use HF Secrets if needed).

Deliverables
1. GitHub repository link
2. Hugging Face Spaces repository link
3. Live Hugging Face app link
4. 60–120s demo video showing CLI run → Streamlit locally → live Space

An image, gif, or video in your README.md file

## Things to still figure out:
What is Daniel and Jared's email or username so I can add them to the repo?
###### Answer: I sent him a message on edstem so we'll find out soon enough. Y'all should see it too.

Should we all bring our computer and work on it together at the library (with ethan on ft ofc) 
  or are we like doing it off of one computer? That might be a dumb question but I wasn't sure lol
###### Answer: We should all bring our own computers becuase each person has tro have at least one visible commit and 1 visible PR
