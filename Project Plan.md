# Project Plan
## DELETE THIS WHEN COMPLETE WITH PROJECT!

### Setup
1. Clone repository and open up workspace
2. Start virtual environment
3. Make sure the libraries are installed on the venv
4. Read in the kaggle dataset

### Create a pipeline that:
1. Cleans the data (removes all na values or imputes them with something)
2. Does some feature engineering (if we need)
3. Does data engineering (specifically grouping and doing what we need to)
4. Data analysis (display a graph or chart with user info vs calculated emmissions with MatPlotLib)

### Create a function gives us the carbon footprint
1. It should take in the dataset 
2. The function should query each entry in the API and capture the carbon footprint
3. It should add the carbon footprint as a column in the same row as the entry it jus queried
4. This function should return the original dataframe with carbon footprint attached to it

### Put it on Streamlit

### Put it on Hugging face (optional if we have time - lol)

## Requirements met:
✅ The python project MUST have a data analysis element

✅ The Python project MUST use an API

✅ The Python project MUST be hosted on the web using Streamlit

✅ The Python project MUST be hosted on Github

❌ Members of the team MUST be members of the Github repository (working on it)

❌ Instructors (that's me) MUST be invited to the repository (We need to know his username to add him)

## Things to still figure out:
What is Daniel and Jared's email or username so I can add them to the repo?

Should we all bring our computer and work on it together at the library (with ethan on ft ofc) 
  or are we like doing it off of one computer? That might be a dumb question but I wasn't sure lol
